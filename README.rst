This is what is planned:

* Refactoring of Chests and Secrets
* Command line to manage Chests and Secrets, and introspect audit data
* Clearer instructions and best-practices around how to organize projects, chests, and secrets.
* Tests? Need to figure out how to test GCP stuff better. Maybe use ``get_kms_client`` mocking.
